PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel has some pencils.
Before she'll start writing her homework, she wants to place them into a mystic pattern for fun.
Different pencils she has may have different lengths.
You are given a vector <int> len. For each i, the length of i-th pencil is len[i]



The pattern she wants to create is called a k-gram.
A k-gram is a pattern consisting of k rows, each of length k.
There are only two types of valid rows:

Yang: A row containing a single pencil of length k.
Yin: A row containing two pencils such that the sum of their lengths is (k-1). The pencils will be separated by a space of length 1.




Compute and return the largest positive integer k such that Fox Ciel can use some of her pencils to form a k-gram.
If she is unable to form any k-grams, return 0 instead.

DEFINITION
Class:FoxAndKgram
Method:maxK
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int maxK(vector <int> len)


CONSTRAINTS
-len will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element in len will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,1,1,1,3}

Returns: 3

All pencils can be used to form a 3-gram. One valid 3-gram follows:

- -
---
- -


1)
{2,2,1,3,5,5,5}

Returns: 5

One of the valid 5-grams:

-----
-- --
- ---
-----
-----


2)
{1}

Returns: 1



3)
{2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2}

Returns: 5



4)
{1,2,3,1,2,4,2,3,1}

Returns: 4

Note that it is not necessary to use all of the pencils.

5)
{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29}

Returns: 0
