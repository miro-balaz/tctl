PROBLEM STATEMENT
This problem statement contains images that may not display properly outside the applet.


There are N characters in the Ninja language. As the number of different characters can be very large, we will use numbers from 1 to N to represent the individual characters in Ninja language.
The characters are numbered in alphabetical order. That is, whenever i < j, character i is earlier in the alphabet than character j. Each string in Ninja language can now be seen as a sequence of integers. When comparing two different strings of the same length, the lexicographically smaller one is the one with a smaller integer on the first place where they differ.


Ninja Ren has a string R of length N that contains each character exactly once. Then she converted the string R to the string S using the following method:


First, Ren takes her string R and writes it onto a circular piece of paper. The paper can now be cut at one of N possible positions, each time producing a different string of length N. Ren takes those N different strings and sorts them into lexicographical order (starting with the lexicographically smallest one). The string S is obtained by taking the last characters of the N sorted strings, in order. In other words, Ren takes the N cyclic rotations of R, sorts them, and then only looks at their last letters.


For example, when R is "2 4 5 1 3", S will be "5 3 1 2 4". The following picture shows how the conversion works.





You are given the int N and a vector <int> first. containing a prefix of the string S. More precisely, for each valid index i, element i of first is the i-th character of S. (Both indices are 0-based.)


Find the lexicographically smallest possible string S. If N is less than or equal to 50, return the entire string S. If N is greater than 50, return just the last 50 characters of S. If there is no such S, return an empty vector <int> instead.

CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 1 and 100,000 inclusive.
-first will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
